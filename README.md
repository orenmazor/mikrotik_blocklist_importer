# Mikrotik Blocklist Importer 

Occasionally I have the mad idea of scrapping pihole and just using the dns server in my mikrotik router.

This script will let you do this mad thing.

It comes as a Taskfile and a terraform project.

The taskfile has two tasks:

```
âžœ task -a                
task: Available tasks for this project:
* sync_with_mikrotik:   Sync with mikrotik
* update_pihole_list:   Download the latest default pihole blocklist
```

`update_pihole_list` downloads the default pihole blocklist. This is good enough for most folks. It'll parse out the noise and generate a derivative file called `urls_to_block`. As of mid 2022, this file has roughly 130000 domains to block.

The next step is `sync_with_mikrotik`, which initializes and sets up a terraform plan for you. This will create a mikrotik dns record for each domain in the list.

I used terraform so that it is easy to revert these changes once I realize how bad of an idea this is going to be, while leaving any existing dns settings in place.
